# atomistic_elastics
This repository contains supplementary forcefields, topologies, and runfiles in the paper 
**In Silico Measurement of Elastic Moduli of Nematic Liquid Crystals** by Hythem Sidky,
Juan J. de Pablo and Jonathan K. Whitmer. 

## What's inside? 
- Gromacs topologies, configurations, and run parameters.
- Representative SSAGES input file for elastic free energy measurement.
- Python scripts used in workflow to generate run files across temperature ranges. 

The **bulk** folder contains an equilibrated configuration used for bulk 
elastic measurements (k_ii). The **cylinder** folder contains an equilibrated
configuration of cylindrically confined 5CB for k_24 measurements.
